# RL,DTR
- Dynamic Treatment Regime = Reinforcement Learning + Medecine
- Aim of DTR improves treatment regime, if data is available use Offline
- If no Data => Models => Online RL => Save Data as benchmark => Offline RL
- Solve them => Model Free (PPO/SAC) or Model Based ( DREAMER/TDMPC), Offline RL IQL, BCL, Or Diffusion Policy, [RL+Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13734)
- Robustness/ Domain Randomization (SMARTS)
DTR + Robustness + Diffusion ?
